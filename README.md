# Express API Project

This week I went backend and build my firstAPI!

The week included

- How to install and setup an Express server.
- How to deploy Node projects.
- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays.

## The problem

This week i wanted to do do a bunch of routes to practice writing them. So i used two different data-sets, just to be able to make some more routes. If i had more time i would for sure make the pagination and also incorporate the beer-data-set i found on kaggle. It would be nice to also make a frontend to present the data.
